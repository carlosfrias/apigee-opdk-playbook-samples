Apigee OPDK Monitoring in Non-Prod Environments
===============================================

We need to configure monitoring for OPDK 4.16.01 that is running on Oracle Linux 6.8. We would normally need to update 
the OS to an EL 7 flavor based on the packages that are being installed. However, we need to make monitoring work on 
Oracle Linux 6.8.
